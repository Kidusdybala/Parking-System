- Direct integration with Chapa payment gateway
- Instant payment verification and processing
- Automatic balance updates
- Real-time transaction tracking

### Option 2: Test API Directly

#### Get a JWT Token First:
```bash

-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "password"
}'
```

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chapa/wallet/topup" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "amount": 100,
    "phone_number": "+251911123456"
}'
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Payment initialized successfully",
    "data": {
        "checkout_url": "https://checkout.chapa.co/checkout/payment/...",
        "tx_ref": "TX_...",
        "amount": 100.00
    }
}
```
