# Chapa Payment Integration Fix

## Problem Summary

The Chapa payment integration had several issues:

1. **Transactions stuck in "pending" status** - Payments were successful on Chapa's side but not being updated in the database
2. **Callback URL not working properly** - Chapa webhooks weren't being processed correctly
3. **User balance not updated** - Even successful payments weren't adding money to user wallets
4. **Poor error handling** - Limited logging and debugging capabilities

## Root Causes

1. **Unreliable webhook processing** - The callback endpoint wasn't robust enough to handle different webhook formats
2. **Missing payment verification** - No automatic verification when users return from Chapa
3. **Insufficient logging** - Hard to debug payment flow issues
4. **Single callback method** - Only POST requests were handled, but Chapa might send GET requests too

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Payment Verification (`ChapaService.php`)

- **Improved `verifyPayment()` method** with comprehensive logging
- **Better error handling** and status checking
- **Prevents duplicate processing** of already-processed transactions
- **Detailed logging** for debugging payment flows

### 2. Robust Webhook Handling (`ChapaService.php`)

- **Enhanced `handleWebhook()` method** that processes webhook data directly
- **Fallback to API verification** if webhook data is incomplete
- **Support for multiple webhook formats** (tx_ref, trx, etc.)
- **Comprehensive logging** of all webhook interactions

### 3. Improved Callback Controller (`ChapaController.php`)

- **Support for both GET and POST** callback requests
- **Detailed request logging** including headers, IP, user agent
- **Better error responses** for debugging
- **Separate handling** for webhooks vs return URL callbacks

### 4. Enhanced Return URL Processing (`ChapaWebController.php`)

- **Automatic payment verification** when users return from Chapa
- **Proper status checking** before processing payments
- **Better error handling** and logging
- **No more unreliable auto-marking** of payments as successful

### 5. Improved Payment Receipt Page

- **Manual verification button** for pending payments
- **Real-time payment status** checking
- **Better user feedback** and error messages
- **AJAX-based verification** without page refresh

### 6. Additional API Endpoints

- **Force verification endpoint** (`POST /api/chapa/verify/{txRef}/force`)
- **GET callback support** (`GET /api/chapa/callback`)
- **Enhanced debugging capabilities**

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Payment Flow

1. **Make a payment** through the wallet top-up or reservation payment
2. **Complete payment** on Chapa's checkout page
3. **Check the receipt page** - it should automatically verify the payment
4. **Verify in database** - transaction status should be "success" and balance updated

### 2. Manual Verification

If a payment is stuck in "pending" status:

1. **Go to the payment receipt page**
2. **Click "Verify Payment" button** (appears for pending payments)
3. **Check the result** - payment should be verified and processed

### 3. Using the Test Script

Run the verification test script:

```bash
php test-payment-verification.php TX_H4JMNLWOAV_1756041050
```

This will:
- Test Chapa API verification
- Test local callback endpoint
- Check database status
- Show user balance

### 4. API Testing

Test the callback endpoint directly:

```bash
# Test GET callback
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/chapa/callback?tx_ref=TX_H4JMNLWOAV_1756041050"

# Test POST callback
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chapa/callback" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tx_ref":"TX_H4JMNLWOAV_1756041050","status":"success"}'
```

### 5. Force Verification API

For authenticated users:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/chapa/verify/TX_H4JMNLWOAV_1756041050/force" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Logging

All payment operations now log detailed information:
- Payment initialization
- Webhook processing
- Verification attempts
- Status changes
- Error conditions

Check logs in `storage/logs/laravel.log` for debugging.

### 2. Robust Error Handling

- **Graceful failure handling** - errors don't break the payment flow
- **Detailed error messages** for debugging
- **Fallback mechanisms** when primary verification fails

### 3. Multiple Verification Paths

- **Webhook processing** (primary method)
- **Return URL verification** (when user comes back from Chapa)
- **Manual verification** (user-triggered)
- **API verification** (for debugging)

### 4. Better User Experience

- **Clear payment status** on receipt page
- **Manual verification option** for stuck payments
- **Proper error messages** and feedback
- **Automatic status updates** without page refresh

## Configuration Check

Ensure your `.env` file has the correct Chapa configuration:

```env
CHAPA_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
CHAPA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
CHAPA_BASE_URL=https://api.chapa.co/v1
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### 1. Check Logs

Monitor the Laravel logs for payment processing:

```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i chapa
```

### 2. Database Queries

Check transaction status:

```sql
SELECT tx_ref, status, amount, paid_at, created_at 
FROM chapa_transactions 
WHERE user_id = 4 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Check user balance:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, balance 
FROM users 
WHERE id = 4;
```

### 3. Webhook Testing

Use tools like ngrok to expose your local server for webhook testing:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Then update your Chapa webhook URL to the ngrok URL.

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes:

1. **Payments should process automatically** when users return from Chapa
2. **Transaction status should update** from "pending" to "success"
3. **User balance should increase** for wallet top-ups
4. **Reservation payments should mark reservations as paid**
5. **Manual verification should work** for any stuck payments
6. **Comprehensive logs should be available** for debugging

## Troubleshooting

If payments are still not working:

1. **Check the logs** for error messages
2. **Run the test script** to verify Chapa API connectivity
3. **Test the callback endpoint** manually
4. **Verify environment variables** are correct
5. **Check database permissions** and connectivity
6. **Use the manual verification button** on the receipt page

The fixes provide multiple layers of verification and fallback mechanisms to ensure payments are processed reliably.
